This code implements the binary search algorithm, which is an efficient way to search for a specific value in a sorted
list of numbers. The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the list in half and eliminating half of the
remaining elements each time, until the target value is found or it can be determined that the value is not in the list.
The code uses a while loop to iterate until the search range has been reduced to zero, and the low and high variables
keep track of the current search range.
The mid variable is used to calculate the middle index of the current search range,
and the code compares the value at the mid index to the target value to determine whether to search the lower or
upper half of the list. If the target value is found, the function returns the index at which it was found.
If the target value is not found, the function returns -1.
